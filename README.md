# Concord

===========================================================================

This project was made with Electron, React an Typescript. Our purpose is to change the UI to a more pleasant and functional one. Also we want to turn all beta features public for users (optional feature).

## Scripts

### `npm run electron:dev`

Runs the Electron app in the development mode.

The Electron app will reload if you make edits in the `electron` directory.<br>

### `npm run electron:build`

Builds the Electron app package for production to the `dist` folder.
